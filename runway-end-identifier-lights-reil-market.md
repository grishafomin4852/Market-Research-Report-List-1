<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Approach Lights</li><li>Runway Lights</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) are a type of lighting system installed at the ends of runways to help pilots identify them during approach and landing. They consist of two synchronized flashing white lights, one on each side of the runway threshold, pointing towards the runway's end. Approach Lights guide pilots during their final descent towards the runway, enhancing visibility and aiding in safe landings. Runway Lights, on the other hand, provide continuous illumination along the runway, assisting pilots during takeoff, landing, and taxiing. These lighting systems play crucial roles in ensuring aviation safety.</p></p>
