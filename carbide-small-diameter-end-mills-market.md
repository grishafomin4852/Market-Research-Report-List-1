<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbide Small Diameter End Mills Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Peripheral Cutting Edge</li><li>End Cutting Edge</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Carbide small diameter end mills are categorized into three market types based on their cutting edge configurations: peripheral cutting edge, end cutting edge, and other markets. The peripheral cutting edge end mills have cutting edges on the outer periphery of the tool, allowing for efficient machining of the workpiece's outer surface. End cutting edge end mills, on the other hand, feature cutting edges on the end face, enabling them to cut through the workpiece from the end. Lastly, the "other" market includes end mills with different cutting edge configurations that do not fall into the previous two categories.</p></p>
