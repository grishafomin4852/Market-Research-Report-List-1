<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Seeds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Seeds</li><li>Genetically Modified Seeds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial seeds are categorized into two main types: conventional seeds and genetically modified (GM) seeds. Conventional seeds refer to the original, non-modified seeds that undergo natural breeding techniques to enhance desired traits such as yield, taste, or disease resistance. On the other hand, GM seeds are altered using biotechnology to introduce specific genes, often from unrelated species, to confer desirable traits like pest resistance or drought tolerance. These genetic modifications aim to improve crop productivity and sustainability, but they have also raised concerns about potential environmental and health impacts.</p></p>
