<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copolyester Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Copolyester Resin</li><li>Thermosetting Copolyester Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copolyester resins are a type of polymer material used in various industries. There are two main types of copolyester resins: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic copolyester resins can be melted and re-molded multiple times without changing their chemical structure. They are commonly used in applications such as packaging and automotive parts. On the other hand, thermosetting copolyester resins undergo a permanent chemical change when heated, and cannot be re-molded once set. They are often used in products that require high temperature resistance, such as electrical components and coatings.</p></p>
