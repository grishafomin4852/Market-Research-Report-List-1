<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PERC Solar Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mono-crystalline</li><li>Polycrystalline</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PERC solar panels market mainly consists of two types: mono-crystalline and polycrystalline panels. Mono-crystalline panels are made from a single crystal structure, resulting in higher efficiency and aesthetics. They are ideal when space is limited. Polycrystalline panels are made from multiple crystal fragments, giving them a lower cost but slightly lower efficiency. These panels are suitable for larger installations where the focus is on cost-effectiveness rather than limited space. Both panel types play a significant role in the PERC solar panels market, catering to different customer preferences and requirements.</p></p>
