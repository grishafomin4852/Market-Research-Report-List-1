<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transient Elastography Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE)</li><li>Controlled Attenuation Parameter(CAP)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Transient Elastography Device Market consists of two main types: Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) and Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP). VCTE utilizes low-frequency vibrations to assess tissue stiffness, allowing for non-invasive evaluation of liver conditions such as fibrosis. CAP, on the other hand, measures the attenuation of ultrasound signals to determine liver fat content. Both technologies play a crucial role in diagnosing liver diseases and provide valuable information for healthcare professionals without the need for invasive procedures.</p></p>
