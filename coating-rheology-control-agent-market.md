<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coating Rheology Control Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based Coating</li><li>Oil-based Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Coating rheology control agents are important additives used in the formulation of coatings to enhance their performance. There are two main types of coating markets: water-based coating and oil-based coating. Water-based coatings use water as the primary solvent, making them more environmentally friendly and easier to clean up. On the other hand, oil-based coatings use petroleum-based solvents, providing better resistance and durability. Both types of coatings require rheology control agents to ensure proper flow, leveling, and viscosity, leading to a high-quality, uniform coating finish.</p></p>
