<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Anchors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injectable Adhensive Anchors</li><li>Capsule Adhensive Anchors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chemical anchors refer to a type of fastening system used for securing objects to concrete or masonry surfaces. The market can be further divided into two types: injectable adhesive anchors and capsule adhesive anchors. Injectable adhesive anchors involve injecting a liquid adhesive into a drilled hole, which hardens and creates a strong bond. On the other hand, capsule adhesive anchors utilize pre-measured capsules containing two components that mix and create a chemical reaction when inserted into a drilled hole, providing a secure fixation. Both types offer reliable and durable solutions for various construction applications.</p></p>
