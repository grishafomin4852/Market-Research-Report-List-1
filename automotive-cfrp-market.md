<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive CFRP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer) market can be classified into two major types: thermosetting and thermoplastic. Thermosetting CFRP is composed of a matrix material that hardens irreversibly upon heating, resulting in a rigid structure. On the other hand, thermoplastic CFRP contains a matrix material that can be melted and reshaped multiple times without undergoing any chemical change. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of manufacturing processes, mechanical properties, and cost, which determine their suitability for different automotive applications.</p></p>
