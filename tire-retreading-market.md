<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Retreading Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire retreading is a process used to extend the life of worn-out tires. Two types of tire retreading markets are pre cure and mold cure. Pre cure retreading involves applying a pre-manufactured tread rubber onto a previously buffed tire casing, which is then cured in a mold to form a new tread design. On the other hand, mold cure retreading includes the application of uncured tread rubber onto the buffed tire casing, which is then placed in a mold and heated to achieve curing and bonding of the tread to the casing.</p></p>
