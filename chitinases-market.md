<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chitinases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endochitinases</li><li>Exochitinases</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Chitinases are enzymes that break down chitin, a complex carbohydrate found in the exoskeleton of insects and other arthropods. There are two main types of chitinases in the market - endochitinases and exochitinases. </p><p>Endochitinases act by cleaving the chitin molecule at random points, breaking it down into smaller fragments. This type of chitinase is commonly used in various industries including agriculture, food processing, and biofuel production.</p><p>Exochitinases, on the other hand, work by sequentially removing chitin monomers from the non-reducing end of the chitin chain. They have diverse applications in areas such as waste management, wastewater treatment, and textile industry for chitin removal.</p><p>Both endochitinases and exochitinases play crucial roles in the degradation and utilization of chitin, offering promising solutions for a wide range of industrial and environmental applications.</p></p>
