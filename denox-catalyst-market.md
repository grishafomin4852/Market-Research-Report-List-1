<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DeNOx Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Honeycomb</li><li>Flat</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The DeNOx catalyst market is divided into two types: honeycomb and flat catalysts. Honeycomb catalysts have a structure similar to honeycombs and offer high surface area due to their multiple channels. They provide efficient conversion of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) into harmless gases. On the other hand, flat catalysts have a flat surface and are known for their compact design. They also have effective NOx reduction capabilities but may have a smaller surface area compared to honeycomb catalysts. Both types play a crucial role in reducing NOx emissions and improving air quality.</p></p>
