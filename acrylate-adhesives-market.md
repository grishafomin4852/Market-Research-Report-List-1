<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylate Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Acrylate adhesives are categorized into two types: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic acrylate adhesives can be softened and reshaped multiple times by applying heat. They retain their original adhesive properties upon resolidification. On the other hand, thermosetting acrylate adhesives undergo a chemical reaction when heated, transforming into a rigid and durable state. While they cannot be reshaped after curing, they offer excellent bond strength and temperature resistance. These two types provide versatile options for different applications, offering flexibility or durability depending on the needs of the end-user.</p></p>
