<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Rhythm Management Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICDs</li><li>CRT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardiac rhythm management device market consists of three major types: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices. Pacemakers are used to regulate the heart's electrical activity and ensure a regular heartbeat. ICDs continuously monitor the heart's rhythm and deliver electric shocks when life-threatening arrhythmias occur. CRT devices are used to treat heart failure by helping all sections of the heart beat in sync. These devices play a crucial role in managing cardiac rhythm disorders and improving patients' quality of life.</p></p>
