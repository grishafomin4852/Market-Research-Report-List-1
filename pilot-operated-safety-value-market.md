<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot Operated Safety Value Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Non-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pilot Operated Safety Valves are used in industrial applications to protect equipment from overpressure. Two common types are Closed Type and Non-closed Type. Closed Type valves have a tightly sealed dome that doesn't allow the fluid to escape once the valve opens, redirecting it to a drain. This ensures that no fluid is released into the environment. Non-closed Type valves, on the other hand, release the fluid into the atmosphere when the valve opens. This type is suitable for applications where it is acceptable to discharge the fluid into the environment.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Pilot Operated Safety Value Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Boiler</li><li>Pressure Vessel</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pilot-operated safety valve is primarily used in various industrial applications, such as boilers, pressure vessels, and other similar systems. In a boiler application, the safety valve ensures the release of excess steam pressure to prevent any potential damage or explosion. Similarly, in pressure vessels and other equipment, the safety valve acts as a crucial safeguard against excessive pressure buildup. The pilot-operated mechanism helps optimize the valve's efficiency and reliability, allowing for safe operation and protection of the equipment and personnel.</p></p>
