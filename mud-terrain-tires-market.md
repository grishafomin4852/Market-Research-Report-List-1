<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mud Terrain Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mud terrain tires market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias-ply tires. Radial tires are constructed with layers of steel belts running perpendicular to the tread, which provides enhanced stability, durability, and better fuel efficiency. These tires offer improved off-road performance by reducing rolling resistance and increasing traction. On the other hand, bias-ply tires are composed of multiple layers of nylon belts that run diagonally across the tread. They offer greater puncture resistance and are well-suited for heavy-duty applications and extreme off-road environments.</p></p>
