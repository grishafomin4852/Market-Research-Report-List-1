<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Material for Restoration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ceramic</li><li>Amalgam</li><li>Composite</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The dental material for restoration market includes three main types: ceramic, amalgam, and composite. Ceramic restorations are made from high-strength porcelain or glass-based materials, providing excellent esthetics and durability. Amalgam restorations are composed of a mixture of metals, mostly silver, which is long-lasting but less aesthetically pleasing. Composite restorations are a tooth-colored resin material that can be bonded directly to the tooth, offering good esthetics and versatility. These three types cater to different patient needs, with ceramic providing aesthetics, amalgam offering durability, and composite providing a balance between esthetics and function.</p></p>
