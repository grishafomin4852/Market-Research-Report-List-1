<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cast Resin Dry-Type Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AN(Naturally-Cooled) Type</li><li>AF(Forced-air-Cooled) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cast resin dry-type transformers are electrical transformers that use epoxy resin as an insulating medium instead of traditional liquid oil. The AN type refers to naturally-cooled transformers, which rely on natural convection of air for cooling. These transformers are suitable for low-power applications as they have limited cooling capacity. The AF type, on the other hand, refers to forced-air-cooled transformers, which use fans or blowers to enhance cooling efficiency. These transformers are suitable for high-power applications as they can provide better cooling capabilities.</p></p>
