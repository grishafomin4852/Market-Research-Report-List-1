<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Polyimide (PSPI) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photosensitive Polyimide</li><li>Negative Photosensitive Polyimide</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photosensitive polyimide (PSPI) is a type of polymer that is sensitive to light and can be chemically altered when exposed to specific wavelengths. It is categorized into two types: positive photosensitive polyimide and negative photosensitive polyimide. In the positive type, the exposed areas become soluble, allowing for the removal of the unexposed material. In contrast, the negative type becomes insoluble when exposed, enabling the retention of the exposed material while removing the unexposed portions. Both types find applications in industries such as electronics, semiconductor manufacturing, and aerospace due to their excellent insulation and temperature resistance properties.</p></p>
