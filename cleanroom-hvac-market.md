<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cleanroom HVAC Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Decentralized</li><li>Centralized</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Cleanroom HVAC market can be categorized into two types - decentralized and centralized. Decentralized HVAC systems are designed to control temperature and air quality in individual cleanrooms. Each cleanroom has its own separate HVAC unit, offering localized control and flexibility. On the other hand, centralized HVAC systems serve multiple cleanrooms from a single unit or system. This option is more cost-effective and efficient as it requires less equipment and maintenance. Both types aim to maintain the desired cleanliness levels in cleanrooms, but decentralized systems offer more control while centralized systems offer cost savings.</p></p>
