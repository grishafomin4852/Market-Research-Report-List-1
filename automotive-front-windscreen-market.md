<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Front Windscreen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive front windscreen market offers two main types of glass: laminated glass and tempered glass. Laminated glass is composed of two glass layers with a layer of plastic in between, offering enhanced safety as it remains intact even if shattered. Tempered glass, on the other hand, is heated and cooled rapidly to increase its strength. Although it does not offer the same level of safety as laminated glass, it is more resistant to thermal stress and breaks into small, less harmful pieces upon impact.</p></p>
