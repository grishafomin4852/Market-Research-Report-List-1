<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Abrasive Polishing Fluid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Action Polishing Fluid</li><li>Chemical Action Polishing Fluid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Abrasive polishing fluids are used to enhance the surface finish of various materials. Mechanical action polishing fluids involve the use of abrasive particles to physically remove imperfections on the surface through rubbing or grinding. Chemical action polishing fluids, on the other hand, use chemical compounds to dissolve or react with the surface, resulting in a smoother finish. Both types of polishing fluids are effective in achieving desired surface qualities, albeit through different mechanisms â€“ mechanical action relies on physical abrasion, while chemical action relies on chemical reactions.</p></p>
