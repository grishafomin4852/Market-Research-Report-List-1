<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anionic Starches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phosphorylated Starch</li><li>Carboxyalkylated Starch</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anionic starches are a type of modified starches that have certain anionic (negative) charges. Two common types of anionic starches are phosphorylated starch and carboxyalkylated starch. Phosphorylated starch is obtained by adding phosphate groups to the starch molecules, which improves its stability and thickening properties. Carboxyalkylated starch, on the other hand, has carboxyl (COOH) groups attached to the starch molecules, providing good water solubility and increased viscosity. Both phosphorylated and carboxyalkylated starches find extensive applications in various industries such as food, paper, textiles, and adhesives.</p></p>
