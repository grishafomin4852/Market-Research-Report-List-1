<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Grown Diamond Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD Diamonds</li><li>HTHP Diamonds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laboratory-grown diamond market consists of two major types: CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) diamonds and HTHP (High Pressure High Temperature) diamonds. CVD diamonds are created by placing a diamond seed in a chamber filled with gases, which are then ionized to deposit carbon atoms onto the seed, leading to the growth of a diamond. On the other hand, HTHP diamonds are formed by applying high pressure and high temperature to a diamond seed in a controlled environment. Both types of laboratory-grown diamonds offer a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to natural diamonds for various industries.</p></p>
