<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Temperature Sensing Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Armoured Cables</li><li>Non-Armoured Cables</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) Cables market includes two main types: Armoured Cables and Non-Armoured Cables. Armoured Cables are designed with an additional layer of protection, consisting of a metal or polymer sheath, to provide enhanced durability and resistance against external factors like moisture, chemicals, and physical damage. On the other hand, Non-Armoured Cables lack this protective layer and are more suitable for applications where the cable is not exposed to harsh environmental conditions or potential risks of damage. Both types cater to different requirements and environments in the DTS industry.</p></p>
