<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jetpack Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrogen Peroxide Driven</li><li>Fuel Driven</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Jetpacks can be classified into two market types: hydrogen peroxide driven and fuel-driven. Hydrogen peroxide driven jetpacks use hydrogen peroxide as a propellant, which decomposes into steam and oxygen when it comes into contact with a catalyst. These jetpacks are smaller, lighter, and simpler to operate. On the other hand, fuel-driven jetpacks utilize a type of fuel, such as kerosene, as a propellant. They are larger, more powerful, and offer longer flight durations. The choice between these market types depends on factors such as flight requirements and intended usage.</p></p>
