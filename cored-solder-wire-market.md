<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cored Solder Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Clean</li><li>Water Soluble</li><li>Rosin Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cored solder wire is available in three main types: no clean, water soluble, and rosin-based. No clean cored solder wire is designed for applications where a residue-free finish is desired. Water soluble cored solder wire is used when post-solder cleaning is necessary, as it easily dissolves in water. Rosin-based cored solder wire contains rosin flux, which provides good wetting properties and leaves a non-conductive residue after soldering. These different types cater to various soldering requirements, ensuring effective bonding and appropriate cleaning options based on desired outcomes.</p></p>
