<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Duct Wrap Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Facings</li><li>Without Facings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass duct wrap insulation refers to a type of insulation material used for insulating HVAC ductwork. It is available in two different market types: with facings and without facings. The "with facings" market refers to fiberglass duct wrap insulation that comes with a protective facing material, which can be made of materials such as foil or kraft paper. This facing provides added protection and helps improve the insulation's performance. On the other hand, the "without facings" market refers to fiberglass duct wrap insulation that lacks any protective facing material. This type of insulation is typically used in applications where additional facing materials are not required.</p></p>
