<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fast Curing Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-fast</li><li>Non-water-tight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fast curing adhesives are used in various industries to bond materials quickly and efficiently. There are two types of fast curing adhesive markets: water-fast and non-water-tight. Water-fast adhesives are resistant to water or moisture and maintain their bonding strength even when exposed to wet conditions. On the other hand, non-water-tight adhesives do not provide complete resistance to water and may weaken or lose their adhesive properties when exposed to water. Both types serve different purposes depending on the application's requirements and environmental conditions.</p></p>
