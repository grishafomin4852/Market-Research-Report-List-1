<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Recylced Glass Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Post Industrial Glass Fiber</li><li>Recycled GFRP Glass Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The recycled glass fiber market consists of two main types: post-industrial glass fiber and recycled GFRP glass fiber. Post-industrial glass fiber is derived from industrial waste, such as scraps from manufacturing processes. It is then transformed into fiber for various applications. Recycled GFRP glass fiber, on the other hand, is made from discarded products containing glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), such as old boats or buildings. The GFRP material is processed and turned into recycled glass fiber, contributing to sustainable practices and minimizing waste in the manufacturing industry.</p></p>
