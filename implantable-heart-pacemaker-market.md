<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Heart Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temporary</li><li>Permanent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable heart pacemaker market consists of two types: temporary pacemakers and permanent pacemakers. Temporary pacemakers are used for short-term treatment and are typically inserted through a vein into the heart. They provide temporary electrical stimulation to regulate the heart's rhythm until the underlying issue is resolved. Permanent pacemakers, on the other hand, are implanted under the skin near the heart and are designed for long-term use. They continuously monitor and regulate the heart's electrical activity, providing a stable and regular heartbeat.</p></p>
